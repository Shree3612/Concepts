# Tiny Habits

## 1. what was the most interesting story or idea for you (BJ Fogg)?
- What I like most is that tiny habits, even ones that take just seconds can lead to big life changes over time.
- For me, starting small like doing one push-up feels doable and less overwhelming.
- I find it interesting that these tiny starts build momentum naturally without needing huge willpower.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- I understand that Behavior (B) happens when Motivation (M), Ability (A), and Prompt (P) all come together.
- Motivation (M) means really wanting to do the habit.
- Ability (A) means being able to do it easily, so it doesn’t feel like a big task.
- Prompt (P) is the reminder or trigger that tells me to act.
- If any one of these is missing, the habit just won’t happen.
- To make habits easier, I try to boost my motivation, keep the habit simple, or create good reminders around me.

## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? 
- I like celebrating small wins because it makes me feel good after doing a habit.
- When I feel happy about completing something, I want to do it again and again.
- Celebrating helps me turn small actions into habits that stick.

## 4. what was the most interesting story or idea for you (1% Better Every Day)?
- For me, the idea that improving just 1% daily adds up to big things over time is super motivating.
- Instead of trying to do everything at once, I find small daily progress much easier.
- Consistency with tiny steps really makes a difference in the long run.

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
- The part I connect with is how habits change your identity.
- It’s not just about what I want to do, but who I want to become.
- Every time I do a habit, it’s like telling myself, “I am that kind of person,” like “I am someone who exercises.”
- This mindset helps me keep habits going longer.

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
- I like breaking habits into small, easy steps.
- I remove anything that could make the habit hard or annoying for me.
- Changing my environment so the habit is obvious really helps.
- I also use reminders or automate parts to make it easier to do.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
- To stop a bad habit, I try to add extra steps or make it less convenient.
- I hide or remove triggers that remind me to do the habit.
- Thinking about the negative effects helps me avoid it.
- Making bad habits a bit annoying or difficult has worked well for me.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
- For me, keeping a book where I can clearly see it reminds me to read.
- I pick books that I find interesting or join a group, so it feels fun.
- I start with just 5 minutes of reading to keep it simple.
- I celebrate finishing a chapter with a small treat or share my progress with friends to stay motivated.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
- I delete apps or turn off notifications to make social media less tempting.
- Reminding myself about how much time it wastes keeps me aware.
- Logging out after each use and putting my phone away makes it harder to get distracted.
- Tracking how social media affects my mood negatively makes me want to cut back.
